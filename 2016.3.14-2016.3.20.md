## How I had feel in these two weeks?
   
   So bad, I felt I waste a lot of time on doing the homework of my courses so that I had no time to do the X-project, even learning web...... This weekend, I sended my resume to A Li, Baidu and Sougou. I hope I could find a good internship. Maybe I should review the knowledge of html5, css3 and ES6.

   1. Coding the Art-Sharer Project
   2. Doing the mission of the drupal project.
   3. Review the knowledge of web.
   4. Learning the ECMAScript 6 standard.
