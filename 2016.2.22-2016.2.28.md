## How I had feel in this week?
   
   This week I had started my new term. The feeling was not bad. I quickly acommodated the life in university. In this term, the courses were not too many. So I had time to do my project. However, the drupal project hadn't started...... As for Art-Sharer project. At the beginning I had decided to use react-canvas the build the editor part of UI. But when I constructed the button, I found that the react-canvas didn't support click event in PC...... So I made bricks without straw.......
   
## The plan of next week

   1. Coding the Art-Sharer Project
   2. Begining the work of drupal project.
   3. Read the book of Canvas.
