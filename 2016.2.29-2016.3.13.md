## How I had feel in these two weeks?
   
   Beacause of homework and other reasons, I didn't write the report last week...... To be honest, I didn't feel well in these two weeks. For one thing, many other students had prepare to looking for internship. I also had send my resume to Tencent, but I still felt that I had not enough capability to be accepted...... For another thing, the drupal project had started, but I had little experience on it. So I didn't do it smoothly. What's more, my labtop had some wrong, it couldn't surf the Internet. I wasted lots of time to check it. Finally I give it to a shop to repair it.
   
## The plan of next week

   1. Coding the Art-Sharer Project
   2. Waiting fot the next mission of the drupal project.
   3. Read the book of Canvas.
   4. Learning the ECMAScript 6 standard.
