## How I had feel in this week?
   
   I came back to my home on Feb 15th, but I still couldn't find the statement in home. I wanted to came back to school as soon as possible...... Because I didn't install linux on my labtop, so I wanted to install it on the computer in my home. But unfortunately, the computer is broken...... I had to continue using my labtop working.

   2. Begin the work of drupal project.
   3. Continue learing Web Audio.
   4. Read the book of Canvas.
